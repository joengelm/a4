Football!!!!  *Princeton Scriptwriting and Song Learning */When (Scriptwriting):/ this Friday, 4:00PM at Andrew\\\\\\'s Commons /When (Song Learning):/ this Friday, 7:00PMish at Historian Zoe\\\\\\'s house  (the house that party was at, you know, the party, you remember that,  right, the party?) Feel free to drop by either or both of these! Scriptwriting is as usual,  but afterwards, we\\\\\\'ll be heading up to Zoe\\\\\\'s house to learn some Band  songs (you know, the ones we sing on the bus, you know, those ones, with  all the words, those songs, yeah, those). There should be some time  after/during scriptwriting to eat before you head up. Again, the house  song learning will be at is 240 Brown Street  <https://www.google.com/maps/place/240+Brown+St,+Providence,+RI+02906/@41.833907,-71.405101,17z/data=%213m1%214b1%214m2%213m1%211s0x89e44521e9795a59:0x830e2fa6ad38463b>.  *Princeton Football */When:/ Saturday, October 18 /Calltime:/ 5:30AMish (UGH) /Uniform:/ KPB We love the Princeton Band! We\\\\\\'ll be doing a joint field show with them,  and singing songs and it\\\\\\'ll be wonderful. Plus, this is our first big  away trip!!!! Ask me if you have any questions about stuff we do on the  Princeton trip if you haven\\\\\\'t been, because it\\\\\\'s amazing (but also  Brooke will probably put it in her email).  So, a couple things. One, after games, section leaders should check the  rows their sections occupied to make sure nothing was left behind. You  guys haven\\\\\\'t been messing up on this at all, but I still want to mention  it to make sure you always do it. I\\\\\\'ll be doing a last check anyway just  in case. :)  Also, I SUCK because I didn\\\\\\'t realize song learning was being scheduled  at the same time as clarinet bonding.... Ugh.... I\\\\\\'m the worst. I hope  you forgive me, and you guys are great for holding bonding and also I  should totally just buy you all ice cream or something.  Also also, if your picture isn\\\\\\'t up on the Band Board page  <http://students.brown.edu/band/site/band-board> yet, you should send me  a vaguely square-shaped one to put up. Same goes for if you\\\\\\'re a new  section leader.  Alright, that\\\\\\'s about it. Here\\\\\\'s your GIF for the week. Remember that  it\\\\\\'s completely optional to put these in your emails. Like, you really  don\\\\\\'t have to. But, like, do if you like a challenge.
